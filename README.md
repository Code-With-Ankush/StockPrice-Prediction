üìä Stock Analysis and Prediction Application
A comprehensive Django-based web application that provides a platform for stock analysis, prediction, and financial data visualization. The application integrates with Yahoo Finance (yFinance) to fetch real-time stock data and uses machine learning models to predict future stock prices.

üåü Features
User Authentication:

Secure login, registration, and logout functionalities.
Decorators ensure authenticated users access sensitive data and pages.
Error handling and user feedback via Django messages.
Dynamic Stock Data Visualization:

Randomized redirection to stock pages using top tickers like AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and more.
Stock data includes the latest closing prices, PE ratios, dividend yield, market cap, and more.
AJAX requests to fetch historical stock data for dynamic charting without page reloads.
Stock Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks:

Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict future stock prices.
Processes and scales stock data, trains the model, and evaluates it using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Plots the predicted and historical stock prices using interactive Plotly graphs.
ARIMA Model for Time Series Analysis:

Predicts future stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.
Ensures data stationarity through differencing before applying the ARIMA model.
Visualizes forecasted prices alongside historical data for comparison.
Comprehensive Feedback Mechanism:

Collects user feedback through a dedicated form, allowing users to rate satisfaction and provide improvement suggestions.
Feedback is securely stored in the database for further analysis.
Detailed Stock Fundamentals:

Displays a wide range of fundamental data for any stock ticker, including market cap, earnings growth, sector, dividend yield, and more.
Allows users to search and analyze stocks quickly and effectively.
